### Welcome to my personal site! 

Recently I have started uploading/migrating my previous and current projects to Github as a better place to share and discuss. 

My major interests are Financial Technology, Financial Data Analytics, Machine Learning. I have been developing programs and writting codes/scripts for analyzing financial data, building financial models and building automation system for Finance, Business practices. I usually program in R, Python, SQL with also frequent usage of HTML, Tableau, Alteryx, Bash, JavaScript, VBA, Spark.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in any of my projects and wish to learn more details of them :)  



#### Project at work: Automatic Financial Reporting System

I developed the Automatic Financial Reporting System when I work as Business Intelligence Analyst at a Fintech company in Toronto. The Company focus on foreign exchange trading and providing global payroll services to clients who have the demands to pay employee globally with different currencies. So they will have monthly financial reporting requirements, they used to rely on manually pull data from SQL Server, Tableau and Salesforce Database and then process transaction data and batch generate statements/reports in Excel VBA. 

However, as data amount getting larger and business rules/calculations applied to process data getting very complex sometimes, the Excel will return errors and undesired results, many manual works and corrections were thus needed and can be time consuming.

So I revised and improved previous data processing procedures & logics and built the new data processing ETL pipeline and reporting system with a combination of R, Python, Alteryx, Tableau Prep, Tableau Server.

The idea is to achieve an all back-end hands-free automatic data ETL + reporting system.

#### Research Project: Video Games Recommendation System 

I completed this Video Games Recommendation System on STEAM games dataset from Kaggle during my MSc study. The system is able to offer real-time recommendation on video games to users and predict the time the user will spend on specific game. 

**Dataset Sample:**

The back-end of the system consists of R and SparkR(Apache Spark implemented from R Environment) and front-end is built using R Shiny. The major machine learning algorithms used is User-Based Collaborative Filtering:
