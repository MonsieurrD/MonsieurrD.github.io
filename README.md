# Welcome to my personal website on Github! 

Recently I have started uploading/migrating my previous and current projects to Github as a better place to share and discuss. 

My major interest is combining Technology with Finance and Business. Specifically I have been developing programs and writting codes/scripts for analyzing financial data, building financial models and building automation system for Finance, Business practices. 

I usually program in R, Python, SQL with also frequent usage of HTML, Tableau, Alteryx, Bash, JavaScript, VBA, Spark.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in any of my projects and wish to learn more details of them :)
