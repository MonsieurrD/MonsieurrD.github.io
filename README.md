## Welcome to my personal website! 

Recently I have started uploading/migrating my previous and current projects to Github as a better place to share and discuss. 

My major interest is Financial Technology, Financial Data Analytics, Machine Learning. I have been developing programs and writting codes/scripts for analyzing financial data, building financial models and building automation system for Finance, Business practices. 

I usually program in R, Python, SQL with also frequent usage of HTML, Tableau, Alteryx, Bash, JavaScript, VBA, Spark.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in any of my projects and wish to learn more details of them :)  



### Recent Project: Automatic Financial Reporting System

I developed the Automatic Financial Reporting System when I work as Business Intelligence Analyst at a Fintech company in Toronto. The Company focus on foreign exchange trading and providing global payroll services to clients who have the demands to pay employee globally with different currencies.

For Financial analysts in Business Analytics department have monthly financial reporting works, they will have to calculate and generate monthly reports/statements based on pre-determined business rules, formulas. The processes used to require many manual works on Excel while Excel also often crashes when data reach a considerable large amount.

My solution is a combination of R, Python, Alteryx, Tableau Prep, Tableau Server, with usually Alteryx used to pull and perform data cleanning on raw transaction data from SQL Server database and R, Python, Tableau Prep used for complex calculation and data transformation and Tableau Server and Python for batch pdf statement generation and distribution.

The idea is to achieve an all back-end hands-free automatic data ETL + reporting pipeline
