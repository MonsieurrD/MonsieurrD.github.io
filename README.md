### Welcome to my site! 

Recently I have started uploading/migrating my previous & current projects to Github as a better place to share and discuss 

**About Me**

##### Recent Project: Automatic Financial Reporting System

I developed the system when I work as Business Intelligence Analyst at a Fintech company in Toronto which focus on foreign exchange trading and global payroll services. They used to rely on manual Tableau and Excel processes and for data processing and reporting. However, there will be errors when input data is too large for Excel to process and the complete data processing, statement generation processes can take analysts 5-7 days to accomplish and then send out the statements to clients at the beginning of each month.

So I built the new data ETL pipeline + reporting system using a combination of R, Python, Alteryx, Tableau Prep, Tableau Server. The idea is to achieve an all back-end hands-free automatic financial reporting system. 

Now the new system helps the analysts to complete the monthly reporting tasks in 1-2 days with most processes automated.

##### Research Project: Video Games Recommendation System 

I completed this Video Games Recommendation System on STEAM games dataset from Kaggle during my MSc study. The system is able to offer real-time recommendation on video games to users and predict the time the user will spend on specific game. 

Dataset Sample:

The back-end of the system consists of R and SparkR(Apache Spark implemented from R Environment) and front-end is built using R Shiny. The major machine learning algorithms used is User-Based Collaborative Filtering:
