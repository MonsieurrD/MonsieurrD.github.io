## Welcome to my Personal Site! 

Recently I have started uploading/migrating my previous and current projects to Github as a better place to share and discuss. 

My major interests are Financial Technology, Financial Data Analytics, Machine Learning. I have been developing programs and writting codes/scripts for analyzing financial data, building financial models and building automation system for Finance, Business practices. 

I usually program in R, Python, SQL with also frequent usage of HTML, Tableau, Alteryx, Bash, JavaScript, VBA, Spark.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in any of my projects and wish to learn more details of them :)  



#### Recent Project: Automatic Financial Reporting System

I developed the Automatic Financial Reporting System when I work as Business Intelligence Analyst at a Fintech company in Toronto. The Company focus on foreign exchange trading and providing global payroll services to clients who have the demands to pay employee globally with different currencies.

For Financial analysts in Business Analytics department have monthly financial reporting works, they will have to calculate and generate monthly reports/statements based on pre-determined business rules, formulas. The processes used to require many manual works on Excel while Excel also often crashes when data reach a considerable large amount.

My solution is a combination of R, Python, Alteryx, Tableau Prep, Tableau Server, with usually Alteryx used to pull and perform data cleanning on raw transaction data from SQL Server database and R, Python, Tableau Prep used for complex calculation and data transformation and Tableau Server and Python for batch pdf statement generation and distribution.

The idea is to achieve an all back-end hands-free automatic data ETL + reporting pipeline

#### Project: Video Games Recommendation System 

I completed this Video Games Recommendation System on STEAM games dataset from Kaggle during my MSc study. The system is able to offer real-time recommendation on video games to users and predict the time the user will spend on specific game. The back-end of the system consists of R and SparkR(Apache Spark implemented from R Environment) and front-end is built using R Shiny. The major machine learning algorithms used is User-Based Collaborative Filtering.
